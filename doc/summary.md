This document is intended for every potential Lugdunum contributor.

In this document you will find an overview of the Lugdunum project as well as the build, installation and uninstallalation procedures for the different supported operating systems.

Each step will be detailed with illustrations in order to let this document be as simple and straightforward as possible, for developers of all levels. It is however required for the developer reading this document to have some background of 3D rendering *and their own systems* as we will not cover the basics, that are usually well documented on other documents and do not enter in the scope of this manual. When appropriate, useful links and resources will be provided for the user.
