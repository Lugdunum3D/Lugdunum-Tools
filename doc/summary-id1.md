This document is intended for every Lugdunum user who wants to install and build the project on their operating systems.

In this document you will find an overview of the Lugdunum project as well as the build and installation procedures for the different supported operating systems.

Each step will be detailed in order to let this document be as simple and straightforward as possible, for developers of all levels. It is however required for the developer reading this document to have some technical background about their own systems, as we will not cover the basics, that are usually well documented on other documents and do not enter in the scope of this manual. When appropriate, useful links and resources will be provided for your convenience.

In summary, when you finish reading this document, you should be able to compile and install the Lugdunum's libraries on your system, and it should be ready to use to develop an app using our 3D engine.
Should you have any question or concern, contact information is present at the end of this document.
