This document is intended for every potential Lugdunum user.

In this document you will find a brief overview of the Lugdunum project as well as the user documentation for using the Lugdunum 3D engine.

In this guide, you will find detailed step by step instructions to build your first application with the Lugdunum 3D engine. Detailed examples with code will be provided to illustrate these steps.

It is however required that you have some basic background about 3D rendering *and your own system (git, cmake, etc.)* as we will not cover the basics, that are usually well documented on other documents and do not enter in the scope of this manual. When appropriate, useful links and resources will be provided for your convenience.

The document ends with an information section, meant to answer the questions you could have after reading: for example how to report bugs, how to contact us, and other useful links.

In summary, when you finish reading this document, you should be able to develop your own application using our engine with new Vulkan APIs, without having to suffer from its verbosity. We hope that this guide will be useful to you and serve as a quick reference in the future!
