title: UD Summary
---

This document is intended for every potential Lugdunum and LugBench user.

This document is split in two parts: the first is focused on Lugdunum, the 3D rendering engine, and on the other hand, the second is focused on LugBench, the benchmarking product.

In the first part of the document you will find a brief overview of the Lugdunum project as well as the user documentation, as a guide for using the Lugdunum 3D engine. In this guide, you will find detailed step by step instructions to build your first application with the Lugdunum 3D engine. Detailed examples with code will be provided to illustrate these steps.

It is however required that you have some background in 3D rendering, and a working knowledge of your own system (git, CMake, etc.) as we will not cover the basics, that are usually well documented on other documents and do not enter in the scope of this manual. When appropriate, useful links and resources will be provided for your convenience.

This first part ends with an information section, meant to answer the questions you could have after reading: for example how to report bugs, how to contact us, and other useful links. When you finish reading this chapter, you should be able to develop your own application using our engine with new Vulkan APIs, without having to suffer from its verbosity. We hope that this guide will be useful to you and serve as a quick reference in the future!

The second part of the document will help the user install a copy of the software on their computer, and teach the user how to use the website.
