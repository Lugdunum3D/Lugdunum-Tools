This document is intended for every potential Lugdunum contributor, or for everyone wanting to know a bit more about the internals of the project.

In this document you will find an overview of the Lugdunum project, and details about how we interfaced with the Vulkan API.

Each section will be detailed with examples with hopes to let this document be as simple and straightforward as possible, for developers of all levels. It is however required that you have some background about 3D rendering *and your own system (git, cmake, etc.)* as we will not cover the basics, that are usually well documented on other documents and do not enter in the scope of this manual. When appropriate, useful links and resources will be provided for your convenience.

The document ends with an information section, meant to answer the questions you could have after reading: for example how to report bugs, how to contact us, and other useful links.

In summary, when you finish reading this document, you should have a rough idea of how Lugdunum's source code is architectured, and you should be able to read through the files without any problems. If anything bugs you, please file an issue and we will be glad to answer any question you may have.
