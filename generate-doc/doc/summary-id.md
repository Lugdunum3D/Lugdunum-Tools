title: ID Summary

This document is intended for every Lugdunum user who wants to install and build the project on their operating systems.

This document is split into two parts: the first focuses on Lugdunum, the 3D rendering engine, and on the other hand, the second is about LugBench, the benchmarking product.

In the first part of the document, you will find an overview of the Lugdunum project as well as the build and installation procedures for the different supported operating systems.

Each step is detailed as much as possible to let this document be as simple and straightforward as possible, for developers of all levels.

It is however required that you have some background in 3D rendering and a working knowledge of your system (git, CMake, etc.) as we will not cover the basics, which are usually well documented on other documents and do not enter in the scope of this manual. When appropriate, useful links and resources are provided for your convenience.

In summary, when you finish reading this part, you should be able to compile and install the Lugdunum's libraries on your system, and it should be ready to use to develop an app using our 3D engine.
Should you have any question or concern, contact information is present at the end of this part.

In the second part of the document, you will find an overview of LugBench, as well as instruction on how to build and install the API, the website, and the desktop application on your machine.
