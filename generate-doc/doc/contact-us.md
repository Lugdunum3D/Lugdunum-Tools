# Contact us

Although this project is initially a school project, as we are opening it to the open-source community, we decided to stay available for any inquiry. The development team is available through a wide range of channels if you want to reach out to us:

## Github

You can find our repositories on Github, at [Lugdunum3D](https://github.com/Lugdunum3D "Lugdunum3D's Github organization"), and report specific problems or questions directly by filing a new issue.

## Mailing list

If you want to write us an email, you can do so at [lugdunum_2018@labeip.epitech.eu](mailto:lugdunum_2018@labeip.epitech.eu).

## Twitter

We also have a Twitter account, [@Lugdunum3D](https://twitter.com/Lugdunum3D), feel free to send us a tweet for quick and short questions!
