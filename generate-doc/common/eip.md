# About the scope of the EIP

The **E**pitech **I**nnovative **P**roject is the final step in a five-year computer science program at the Paris Graduate School of Digital Innovation (also know as EPITECH), a program that distinguishes itself from others by its focus on practical projects rather than theory.

The EIP is a group project, which spans the 4th and 5th year of the program, which aims to have in the end a finished project that has actual lasting value; is well documented and is immediately usable in a professional environment. It is a chance for students to acquire skills and experience in accomplishing tasks which aim to emulate the real world working environment.

Just like a real large scale project. The students are not only faced with technical problems, but they are also tasked with handling marketing, communication, team management as well as writing and maintaining professional documentation, technical or otherwise.

The EIP is the amalgamation of EPITECH's project-oriented vision. It aims to symbolize the transition between student and professional life.
